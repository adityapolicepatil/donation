            <p><h3>Why Donate?</h3>
                Every <strong>two seconds</strong>, someone in the world needs blood. Blood transfusions are critical for a variety of medical situations, including:
                <br><br>
                <li>Accident and trauma victims </li>
                <li>Cancer patients undergoing treatment</li>
                <li>Individuals undergoing surgery</li>
                <li>People with chronic illnesses like sickle cell disease</li>
                Blood cannot be manufactured and has a short shelf life.  Donated blood is essential to ensure a constant supply for those in need. A single blood donation can be separated into its components (red blood cells, plasma, platelets) and used to help multiple people.<br>
                <br>
                <h3>Who Can Donate?</h3>
                <h4>Most healthy adults can donate blood. Here's a general overview of eligibility criteria:</h4> 
                <li>Age: Typically between 17-75 years old (age may vary slightly by location)</li>
